    <p>
      <a href="#NOWHARE">Money</a> is any item or verifiable record that is
      generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of
      debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic
      context.[1][2][3] The primary functions which distinguish money are as a
      medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a
      standard of deferred payment. Money was historically an emergent market
      phenomenon that possess intrinsic value as a commodity; nearly all
      contemporary money systems are based on unbacked fiat money without use
      value.[4] Its value is consequently derived by social convention, having
      been declared by a government or regulatory entity to be legal tender;
      that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of
      the country, for "all debts, public and private", in the case of the
      United States dollar. Contexts which erode public confidence, such as the
      circulation of counterfeit money or domestic hyperinflation, can cause
      good money to lose its value. The money supply of a country comprises all
      currency in circulation (banknotes and coins currently issued) and,
      depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank
      money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other
      types of bank accounts). Bank money, whose value exists on the books of
      financial institutions and can be converted into physical notes or used
      for cashless payment, forms by far the largest part of broad money in
      developed countries

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      The word money derives from the Latin word moneta with the meaning "coin"
      via French monnaie. The Latin word is believed to originate from a temple
      of Juno, on Capitoline, one of Rome's seven hills. In the ancient world,
      Juno was often associated with money. The temple of Juno Moneta at Rome
      was the place where the mint of Ancient Rome was located.[8] The name
      "Juno" may have derived from the Etruscan goddess Uni (which means "the
      one", "unique", "unit", "union", "united") and "Moneta" either from the
      Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word
      "moneres" (alone, unique). In the Western world a prevalent term for
      coin-money has been specie, stemming from Latin in specie, meaning 'in
      kind'.[9]

      Counterfeiting Main article: Counterfeit money Counterfeit money is
      imitation currency produced without the legal sanction of the state or
      government. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud or
      forgery. Counterfeiting is almost as old as money itself. Plated copies
      (known as Fourr√©es) have been found of Lydian coins which are thought to
      be among the first western coins.[50] Historically, objects that were
      difficult to counterfeit (e.g. shells, rare stones, precious metals) were
      often chosen as money.[51] Before the introduction of paper money, the
      most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with
      pure gold or silver. A form of counterfeiting is the production of
      documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions.
      During World War II, the Nazis forged British pounds and American dollars.
      Today some of the finest counterfeit banknotes are called Superdollars
      because of their high quality and likeness to the real U.S. dollar. There
      has been significant counterfeiting of Euro banknotes and coins since the
      launch of the currency in 2002, but considerably less than for the U.S.
      dollar.[52]
