}); //So the reason we use a virtual in case you skipped that video is that we don't need to store this on our model or in the database because it's just derived from the information we're already storing. We're storing the URL. It's not like we're storing an image in Mongo, it's just a URL.So why store two? If we can just make a virtual property that will look to us to the human eye as if it's stored on or stored in our database. But it's not every time we call thumbnail, it's going to do this little calculation, which is it's very lightweight and that's fine. But instead of having slash upload, replace that with slash upload slash w 200 and also you should
